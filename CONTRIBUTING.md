# Contribute
Contributing to this project is really simple. 
- First you head over to the [Issues page]( https://github.com/Emil8250/SuperGamblino/issues "Issues") and look for an issue you'd like to work on.
  - If you don't find an issue you'd like to work on, you can simply create one.
 - When you've found an issue to work on, you fork this repository, create your feature, fix your bug, or whatever the issue is. 
 - Then you create a pull request, and if it's accepted it'll end up on the master branch.
